# Demand_forecasting_and_tracebility_system_for_griculture_products
Agricultural supply chains often suffer from inefficiencies due to poor demand forecasting and weak product tracebility, leading to imbalances, waste and financial losses for farmers. Our approach addresses these challenges by providing farmers with multiple distributor options, ensuring they receive fair compensation for their crops. By leveraging demand forecasting, farmers can grow the right crops at the right time, reducing surplus production and minimizing waste
Additionally, our tracebility system enhances transparency by tracking the lifespan of crops, enabling repurposing of expired produce and improving overall quality control. This solution not only  stabilizes the supply chain by balancing supply with demand but also ensures fir pricing, higher profitability for farmers, and a more sustainable agricultural ecosystem.
